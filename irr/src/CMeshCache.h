	That method searches the list of loaded meshes if a mesh has already been loaded and
	returns a pointer to if	it is in that list and already in memory. Otherwise it loads
	the mesh. With IMeshCache::addMesh(), it is possible to pretend that a mesh already
	has been loaded. This method can be used for example by mesh loaders who need to
	load more than one mesh with one call. They can add additional meshes with this
	method to the scene manager. The COLLADA loader for example uses this method.
