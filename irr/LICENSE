  Please note that the Irrlicht Engine is based in part on the work of the
  Independent JPEG Group, the zlib, libPng and aesGladman. This means that if you use
  the Irrlicht Engine in your product, you must acknowledge somewhere in your
  documentation that you've used the IJPG code. It would also be nice to mention
  that you use the Irrlicht Engine, the zlib, libPng and aesGladman. See the
  corresponding license files for further informations. It is also possible to disable
  usage of those additional libraries by defines in the IrrCompileConfig.h header and
  recompiling the engine.
