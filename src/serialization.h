/*
	Map format serialization version
	--------------------------------

	For map data (blocks, nodes, sectors).

	NOTE: The goal is to increment this so that saved maps will be
	      loadable by any version. Other compatibility is not
		  maintained.

	0: original networked test with 1-byte nodes
	1: update with 2-byte nodes
	2: lighting is transmitted in param
	3: optional fetching of far blocks
	4: block compression
	5: sector objects NOTE: block compression was left accidentally out
	6: failed attempt at switching block compression on again
	7: block compression switched on again
	8: server-initiated block transfers and all kinds of stuff
	9: block objects
	10: water pressure
	11: zlib'd blocks, block flags
	12: UnlimitedHeightmap now uses interpolated areas
	13: Mapgen v2
	14: NodeMetadata
	15: StaticObjects
	16: larger maximum size of node metadata, and compression
	17: MapBlocks contain timestamp
	18: new generator (not really necessary, but it's there)
	19: new content type handling
	20: many existing content types translated to extended ones
	21: dynamic content type allocation
	22: minerals removed, facedir & wallmounted changed
	23: new node metadata format
	24: 16-bit node ids and node timers (never released as stable)
	25: Improved node timer format
	26: Never written; read the same as 25
	27: Added light spreading flags to blocks
	28: Added "private" flag to NodeMetadata
	29: Switched compression to zstd, a bit of reorganization
